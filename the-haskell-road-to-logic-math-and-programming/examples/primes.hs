-- let n > 1 be a natural number. Then we use LD(n) for the least natural number
-- greater than 1 that divides n. A number d divides n if there is a natural
-- number a with aÂ·d = n. In other words, d divides n if there is a natural
-- number a with n = a, i.e., division of n by d leaves no remainder. Note that
-- LD(n) exists for d every natural number n > 1, for the natural number d = n
-- is greater than 1 and divides n. Therefore, the set of divisors of n that are
-- greater than 1 is non-empty. Thus, the set will have a least element.

-- Propositions:
-- if n > 1 then LD(n) is a prime number;
-- if n > 1 and n is not a prime number, then (LD(n))^2 <= n.
