# The Haskell Road to Logic, Math and Programming

Here are some examples taken from the book with the same name (almost) of the
current directory.

The book can be viewed here:
  `https://fldit-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/~peter/PS07/HR.pdf`

That book and some others can be found here:

Thanks @vhf and everyone on the @EbookFoundation for your efforts on sharing
knowledge.
